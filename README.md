# The Flitter Keyboard

Flitter is an minimalist unibody split keyboard with 42 keys. The layout is inspired by the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard but without the complexity of a fully split keyboard. It is built using my [keyboard-toolbox](https://github.com/kleinpa/keyboard-toolbox) which generates most design artifacts programatically from a tweakable keyboard definition.
